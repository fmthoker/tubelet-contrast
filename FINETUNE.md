# Fine-tuning  Tubelet-contrastive Models


We use the original SEVERE BENCHMARK codebase for finetuning. We add the **off-the-shelf** scripts to the SEVERE codebase for finetuning. in the [scripts folder](scripts).

-  Setup the SEVERE BENCHMARK repository and follow the finetuning instructions. 
.

-  For example, to fine-tune Tubelet-Contrast R2plus1d-18 on **Something-Something V2, Fine-Gym, Diving, UCF101 and HMDB** , you can run the respective scripts in [action_recognition folder](https://github.com/fmthoker/SEVERE-BENCHMARK/tree/main/action_recognition/scripts_domain_shift/scripts_tubelet_contrast) of the SEVERE-BENCHMARK codebase
